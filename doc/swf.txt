1)SWF general:
http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf/pdf/swf_file_format_spec_v10.pdf (see pages 26 to 33)

-If the swf contains a <DefineABC /> tag (ActionscriptByteCode?,AS3) a <FileAttributes/> tag is mandatory.

-If the swf contains a <MetaData /> tag you must set the 'hasMetaData' attribute to true in the <FileAttributes/> tag.

-If you set the attribute 'hasMetaData' to true in the <FileAttributes/> tag then the swf must contain a <MetaData /> tag.

-A swf contains at least one <ShowFrame/> tag.
A basic swf (a movie with 3 empty frames) looks like:

<swf>
        <ShowFrame />
        <ShowFrame />
        <ShowFrame />
</swf>
Update: A new attribute count is added so that the above can be written as:
<swf>
        <ShowFrame count="3"/>
</swf>

The FlashPlayer will start parsing/playing the tags from the top till it reaches the <EndFrame/> tag.
When it encounters a <ShowFrame/> it renders the previous tags to the screen.
Note that although the <EndFrame/> tag is available for use, under normal circumstances you will never need it as it is added to the end of your file automatically by hXswfML.

2)hXswfML syntax:
-Element names are not case sensitive. <fileattributes/> is equally valid to <FileAttributes>
-The attribute names are case sensitive.
-Most tags have some default values set:
Using <swf/> will be compiled as <swf width="800" height="600" fps="30" version="10" compressed="true" frameCount="1" />
If you only want to change the framerate you would use: <swf fps="12"/>
-Some tags have mandatory attributes which must be set. The program will throw an error and tell you what attribute is missing in which tag.

The names of some elements in the hxswfml may seem confusing at some points (DefineSprite defines a MovieClip for example), but they are kept the same as much as possible as in the official swf file specifications, making a lookup for information more easy.

-Definition tags vs control/displaytags
To define a character use a definition tag.
Example:

<DefineShape id="1">
		<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
    <DrawRect width="100" height="100"/> 
</DefineShape>

creates a black 100x100 rectangle.
The id of this tag must be unique in the swf.

To show this rectangle you must place it on the display list with a control/display tag.
Example:

<PlaceObject id="1" depth="1" />

-id refers to the definition tag that has set id to 1.
-the depth must be unique in the swf

To render to screen you conclude with a <ShowFrame/> tag.
Everything that has been put on or removed from the display up until the next <ShowFrame/> will be rendered to screen.

A movie with 1 frame, rendering a black rectangle on screen looks like:

<swf>
        <DefineShape id="1"> 
					<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
          <DrawRect width="100" height="100"/> 
        </DefineShape>
        <PlaceObject id="1" depth="1" />
        <ShowFrame/>
</swf>

Multiframe movies:
To show a black rectangle in frame 1 and a red rectangle in frame 2 you use:

<swf frameCount="2">
        <DefineShape id="1">
					<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
          <DrawRect width="100" height="100"/> 
        </DefineShape>
                
        <DefineShape id="2"> 
					<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
          <DrawCircle width="200" height="200"/> 
        </DefineShape>
        
        <PlaceObject id="1" depth="1" />
        <ShowFrame/>
        
        <RemoveObject depth="1" />
        <PlaceObject id="2" depth="1" />
        <ShowFrame/>
</swf>

You can omit the <RemoveObject/> tag by using the move attribute in the PlaceObject? tag:

        <RemoveObject depth="1" />
        <PlaceObject id="2" depth="1" />
equivalent/shortcut:
        <PlaceObject id="2" depth="1" move="true" />

A more complete explanation of the move attribute can be found in the swf file specs on page 35.
Short summary:

    The move and id attributes indicate whether a new character is being added to the display list, or a character already on the display list is being modified:

        -move = false and id is present: A new character (id) is placed on the display list at the specified depth.
        -move = true and id is absent: The character at the specified depth is modified. Because any given depth can have only one character, no id is required.
        -move = true and id is present: The character at the specified Depth is removed, and a new character (id) is placed at that depth.

MovieClips?:
A movieclip can be considered as a 'mini swf'. A limited set of the swf tags can be used inside a movieclip:
Available tags are: <PlaceObject/>, <RemoveObject/>, <StartSound/>, <FrameLabel/>, <ShowFrame />, <EndFrame />
Example of a 2 frame movieclip showing a black rectangle in frame 1 and a red rectangle in frame 2:

<swf>
        <DefineShape id="1">
					<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
          <DrawRoundRect width="100" height="100" r="25"/> 
        </DefineShape>
                
        <DefineShape id="2"> 
					<BeginFill color="0x000000" alpha="1.0" />
          <DrawEllipse width="200" height="150"/> 
        </DefineShape>

        <DefineSprite id="3" frameCount="2">
                <PlaceObject id="1" depth="1" />
                <ShowFrame/>
                <PlaceObject id="2" depth="1" move="true" />
                <ShowFrame/>
        </DefineSprite>
        
        <PlaceObject id="3" depth="1" />
        
        <ShowFrame/>
</swf>
